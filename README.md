### Some features of this project

- **Navigation:** It includes a sticky navigation bar (StickyNavbar) at the top, providing navigation options for users.

- **Hero Section:** There's a hero section with a carousel (CarouselWithContent) that likely displays rotating images or content to grab users' attention.

- **Featured Conferences:** A section displaying featured conferences with an image and cards (CardItem). These cards are likely clickable and lead to more detailed conference information.

- **Animation:** The content has animations applied using the "AOS" library, which adds visual effects to elements as the user scrolls down the page.

- **Login & Register:** The login page allows users to sign in using their email and password, with options to remember login details or use social login via Google and Github. For new users, there's a link to the registration page to create an account with name, email, password, and profile photo. Toast notifications provide feedback.
